## Cursor and image animation with GSAP

GSAP Cursor move animation with moving images on pointermove.

Based on [CodeGrid's YT video](https://youtu.be/3-v360P1rUY?si=r1KIZ-W-DLxTBXhf), slightly modified to work on mobile.

Assets gotten from the original [website](https://www.savoirfaire.nyc/)

One of projects that will be based on others' to effectively learn the principles behind animation.
